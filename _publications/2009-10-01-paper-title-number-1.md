Due to its ability to effectively describe the fuzziness and reliability of information, Z-numbers have been extensively utilized in decision-making systems. As the relevant research gradually matures, the decision environment that Z-number needs to face becomes increasingly complex, and the information that needs to be processed is becoming more precise. Consequently, the differences between Z-numbers become more subtle. Therefore, accurately measuring the distance between two Z-numbers is crucial. Among the existing methods for measuring Z-number distances, most suffer from issues such as inadequate understanding of Z-numbers, information loss, and subjective calculations. To address these challenges, a transformation-based Z-number distance measure using belief functions and ERP method is proposed in this paper. This method can effectively identify differences arising from various information changes contained within Z-numbers. Furthermore, some key properties of the proposed distance measure between Z-numbers are also discussed. Various experiments illustrate its effectiveness and robustness. Additionally, a comparative analysis with existing Z-number distance measurement methods through numerical examples further demonstrates the wide applicability of the proposed method.
