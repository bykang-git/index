How to evaluate the reliability and relative weight of the evidence play a key role in improving the performance of the model using Dempster–Shafer(D–S) evidence theory. A new method of evaluating the reliability and relative weight of the evidence using approximate evidential mutual information is proposed. First, the reliability of evidence sources is evaluated based on the approximate mutual information between evidence sets as the global reliability. Second, the relative weight of other evidence is obtained according to the similarity relative to the optimal global reliability. Third, the comprehensive quality of each evidence is measured by aggregating the global reliability and relative weight as a discount factor. Finally, all corrected evidence is fused by the Dempster combination rule to obtain a final result. The proposed method has better performance and strong stability in the evaluation of plant taxonomy based on morphological characteristics, which provides a reliable basis for plant taxonomy.
